research.thaumic_arcana.metal_transmutation.title=Metal Transmutation
research.thaumic_arcana.metal_transmutation.stage.1=I've been grown tired of constantly going deeper into the mines to gather the resources that I need. After heavily researching different metals, I realised that even tough they have different properties, fundamentally they are the same. I need to investigate it further.
research.thaumic_arcana.metal_transmutation.stage.2=I DID IT! Iron is the most simple among all metals, so it can serve as a "blank slate" for all the other metals. Going from there, I only need to add other aspects to it for it to transform. Also, I can only use nuggets for the process, because otherwise I can't get the essentia to penetrate the metal correctly. <BR/>Even tough it's only iron that can be transmuted, it's still going to walk a long way towards fulfilling my needs.

research.thaumic_arcana.biomancy.title=Biomancy
research.thaumic_arcana.biomancy.stage.1=The biothaumic mind was a big success at harnesing organic substances to create new devices. Ever since that I was toying with the idea of applying more magic to organic matter.

research.thaumic_arcana.plantlife.title=Plantlife
research.thaumic_arcana.plantlife.stage.1=The first thing I should study, is how plants react to magic. I know it for sure, that plantlife can absorb magical energies, since there are magical plants around me.

research.thaumic_arcana.creatures.title=Living Creatures
research.thaumic_arcana.creatures.stage.1=Working with the living proves to be harder. Breathing organisms seem to actively resist magic, which makes these studies significantly harder.

research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.title=Plant growth
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.1=I have a theory, that the aspects creating the elements that plants need to grow, should be able to create a reacton that will cause the plant to grow. Either that, or it will blow it up.
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.2=The first steps are promising. Using alchemic principles, I was able to trigger rapid growth in seeds. Unfortunatly, the resulting plant did not yielded anything to repeat the process. I need to try it on other plants
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.3=Other plants are reacting much better than weat, resulting in a net gain. The methodology is still not perfect, but the results look edible.
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.4=I have to see if what happens when I use different breeds of plants. Maybe that ca give me answers.
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.6=Now I can grow alchemically grow my food on demand.The infertility problem of some plants proves to be harder to get rid of than I anticipated.

research.thaumic_arcana.incubated_egg.title=Incubated Egg
research.thaumic_arcana.incubated_egg.stage.1=I think I've gone far enough with plants to attempt to apply the same principles to animals. AS a starting point, I'm going to apply heat and life energy to an egg, in an attempt at supporting it's growth.
research.thaumic_arcana.incubated_egg.stage.2=The egg responded the way I expected. After a few attempts with half grown animals, I managed to find the ratios of essentia I need to get an egg, that will hatch a chicken every single time.<LINE> I also have to note, that the shell of the egg became harder (I have no idea why), so throwing the egg around is inadvised, because it can damage the embrio.

research.thaumic_arcana.flesh_growth.title=Fleshing it out
research.thaumic_arcana.flesh_growth.stage.1=Now that I observed how essentia affects the growth of an animal, I could apply it in a different fashion. I have a theory, that I can use victus to trigger the growth of meat, outside the animal. I'm going to add some beastia as well, just in case the tissue needs a more familiar environment.
research.thaumic_arcana.flesh_growth.stage.2=Complete success. Now I am able to farm meat, whitout growing the whole animal, and interestingly enough, I only need victus to do so. I'll take note on that.

research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.stage.1=Now that I know how adding essentia to plants affect them, I can try to create a different application. I'm going to create a more potent fertiliser. I was thinking about bone meal, but it might fizzle if I add too much essentia. Instead of that, I'm going to take my experience from the time I made a focus.<BR/>I'm going to try to use an Herba crystal to absorb the aspects required to trigger growth. It should also help to make sure that my substance is actually compatible with plants.
research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.stage.2=Complete success. I created a new fertiliser, that I can aqquire more asily than traditional substances.
research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.stage.3=Now I can make it more efficiently.
research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.stage.4=After further experiments, I reached the peek of my efficiency. I can not get more our of this essence.
research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.title=Alchemical Fertilising

research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.title=Creature Enchantments
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.stage.1=My studies on infusion enchantment and biomancy lead me to the idea that with the right metodology, I could enchant living flesh, as I would enchant a regular tool.<BR/>I can't just put animals under the infusion altar though. Living and breating creatures have a tendency towards rejecting magic, something I've been experiencing even more while working with remains.<LINE> But, potions give a different perspective on the topic. They can infuse living creatures with magical abilities, which means that my attempts are not futile.<LINE> Going back to the enchantment route, I belive I could create a book, that contains the right incantations to apply enchantments to animals. If it's possible than I'll need some salis mundus to carry the magic along, since I will not have the ability to hammer it into my subject.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.stage.2=The first enchantment I created is a very basic one. it boosts the reproductive ability of any animal that I apply it to. One extra per parent. <br> Altough, if I want to go further than amplifying basic functions I'll need to focus my research a little more.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.stage.3=So, now I see how I can amplify the power of the enchantments. I need more research. There must be some more that I can do.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.stage.4=
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.stage.5=That is it for now. I created powerfull enchantments that I can apply to living beings. I think I can move forward to attempting more in Biothaumaturgy now that I understand more about the interaction of flesh and magic.

research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant_advanced.title=Advanced Creature enchants
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant_advanced.stage.1=There must be more for me to do. I prepared some things for more advanced enchantments.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant_advanced.stage.2=Increasing the creature's strength was a little harder. I can't just make it stronger, Ã­I also have to prepare the enchantments that will make it's body handle the increased stress. Otherwise, the limbs will fall off, or the body will injure itself from within as it can not handle the power.

research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.creature_enchanter_fertile=The fertility enchantment allows enchanted animals to give birth to additional offspring. Each enchanted parent provides one extra.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.creature_enchanter_protection=The protection enchatment is very straightforward: every level will devide the damage that the enchanted creature will recive.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.creature_enchanter_respiration=The respiration enchantment allows the enchanted creature to breath underwater.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.creature_enchanter_strength=The strength enchanter multiplies the attack damage of the enchanted entity.

research.thaumic_arcana.self_enchantment.title=Self Enchantment
research.thaumic_arcana.self_enchantment.stage.1=I can put enchantments on all kinds of creatures. But what if I could put them on myself? I must try it out!
research.thaumic_arcana.self_enchantment.stage.2=Total failure. My body is still weak and shaking. I can't handle the process, about halfway through, I started to feel sick, than I was shaking violently, and was unable to pronounce the incantations.<BR/> I have experienced similar reactions when I first did this to animals, but I didn't expected this. <LINE> If I could mitigate the resistance of my body, than I could move forward with it.

research.thaumic_arcana.nutrient_mix.title=Nutrient Mix
research.thaumic_arcana.nutrient_mix.stage.1=Knowing how to grow fresh meat is good, but what If I still need the whole animal? Could I increase the growth, so I don't need to wait for that long?
research.thaumic_arcana.nutrient_mix.stage.2=I created a recipe for a special kind of mixture, that is able to speed up the growth of any animal.
