research.thaumic_arcana.metal_transmutation.title=Metal Transmutation
research.thaumic_arcana.metal_transmutation.stage.1=I've grown tired of constantly going deeper into the mines to gather the resources that I need. After heavily researching different metals, I realized that even though they have different properties, fundamentally they are the same. I need to investigate further.
research.thaumic_arcana.metal_transmutation.stage.2=I DID IT! Iron is the most simple among all metals, so it can serve as a "blank slate" for all other metals. Going from there, I only need to add other aspects to it for it to transform. Also, I can only use nuggets for the process: otherwise I can't get the essentia to penetrate the metal correctly. <BR/>Even though it's only iron that can be transmuted, it still goes a long way towards fulfilling my needs.

research.thaumic_arcana.biomancy.title=Biomancy
research.thaumic_arcana.biomancy.stage.1=The biothaumic mind was a major success at harnessing organic substances to create new devices. Ever since then, I was toying with the idea of applying more magic to organic matter.

research.thaumic_arcana.table.title=Experiment Table
research.thaumic_arcana.table.stage.1=To further my experiments, I drawn up designs, for a new table that includes all the tools I might need.<BR> To create it, I need to take 2 bottles and a stick into my hands, than put them on some greatwood planks. This workstation will also come in handy for research and theorycrafting.
research.thaumic_arcana.table.application=I can use the experiment table to apply formulas to different items, by right clicking the table with the item in my main hand, and the formula in my offhand.
research.thaumic_arcana.table.magic_application=I can also use the enchanting table to apply magical items, in a similar way to the Experiment Table.
research.thaumic_arcana.table.cage=To start up my experiments on animals, I'll need some test subjects.To keep them somewhere, I created a small cage at the base of my experiment table. I can access it through the door, on the right side of the table.


research.thaumic_arcana.plantlife.title=Plant-life
research.thaumic_arcana.plantlife.stage.1=The first thing I should study is how plants react to magic. I know for sure that plant-life can absorb magical energies, since there are magical plants around me.

research.thaumic_arcana.creatures.title=Living Creatures
research.thaumic_arcana.creatures.stage.1=Working with the living proves to be harder. Breathing organisms seem to actively resist magic, which makes them significantly harder to work with.<BR> But I have a plan: I have written up a recipe for an experimental formula that can theoretically stabilize the essentia enough to be safely used on living beings.
research.thaumic_arcana.creatures.stage.2=The substance is indeed stable enough, but it's also much weaker than the liquid form. It will not cause a revolution in how we practice thaumaturgy, but it will serve me well.
research.thaumic_arcana.creatures.formula= To create the base of a formula, right click the Experiment Table with an empty bottle, and some salis mundus.

research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.title=Plant growth
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.1=I believe that the aspects creating the elements that plants need to grow should be able to create a reaction that grows the plant instantaneously... or explode on the spot.
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.2=The first steps are promising: using alchemical principles, I was able to trigger rapid growth in seeds. Unfortunately, the resulting plant did not yield anything to repeat the process. I must try it on other plants.
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.3=Other plants are reacting much better than wheat, resulting in a net gain. The methodology is still not perfect, but the results look edible.
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.4=I have to see what happens when I use different breeds of plants. Maybe that can give me answers.
research.thaumic_arcana.wheat.stage.5=Now I can alchemically grow my food on demand. The infertility problem of some plants proves to be harder to get rid of than I anticipated.

research.thaumic_arcana.incubated_egg.title=Incubated Egg
research.thaumic_arcana.incubated_egg.stage.1=I think I've gone far enough with plants to attempt to apply the same fundamental principles to animals. As a starting point, I'm going to apply heat and life energy to an egg in an attempt at supporting it's growth.
research.thaumic_arcana.incubated_egg.stage.2=The egg responded the way I expected. After a few attempts with disturbing half grown animals, I managed to find the ratios of essentia I need to get an egg that will hatch a chicken every single time.<LINE> I also have to note that the shell of the egg became harder (I have no idea why), so throwing the egg around is inadvisable because it can damage the embryo.


research.thaumic_arcana.flesh_growth.title=Fleshing it out
research.thaumic_arcana.flesh_growth.stage.1=Now that I observed how essentia effects the growth of an animal, I can apply it in a different fashion. Theoretically, I can use Victus to trigger the growth of meat outside the animal. I'm going to add some Beastia as well, just in case the tissue needs a more familiar environment.
research.thaumic_arcana.flesh_growth.stage.2=The experiment was a complete success. Now I am able to farm meat without growing the whole animal, and interestingly enough, I only need Victus to do so. I'll take note on that.

research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.title=Alchemical Fertilization
research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.stage.1=Now that I know how adding essentia to plants affect them, I can try to create a different application. I'm going to create a more potent fertilizer. I was thinking about bone meal, but it might fizzle if I add too much essentia. Instead of that, I'm going to take my experience from the time I made a focus.<BR/>I'm going to try to use an Herba crystal to absorb the aspects required to trigger growth. It should also help to make sure that my substance is actually compatible with plants.
research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.stage.2=This experiment was a resounding success. I created a new fertilizer that I can acquire more easily than traditional substances(bone meal, bone meal, and... oh, just bone meal).
research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.stage.3=Now I can make this substance more efficiently.
research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.stage.4=The substance reached the point where I can use it for further experiments. Its quality should be improved further.
research.thaumic_arcana.fertiliser.stage.5=After more trial and error, I reached the peek of my efficiency. I can not get more out of this fertilizer.

research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.title=Creature Enchantments
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.stage.1=My studies on infusion enchantment and Biomancy lead me to the idea that, with the right methodology, I could enchant living flesh as I would enchant a regular tool.<BR/>I can't just put animals under the infusion altar though. Living and berating creatures have a tendency to reject magic, something I've been experiencing even more while working with remains.<LINE> That being said, potions give a different perspective on the topic. They can infuse living creatures with magical abilities, which means that my attempts are not futile.<LINE> Going back to the enchantment route, I believe that I could create a book that contains the right incantations to apply enchantments to animals. If it's possible, I'll need some salis mundus to carry the magic along, since I will not have the ability to hammer it into my subject.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.stage.2=The carrier is complete. This special substance is able to bridge some of the incompatibilities between magic, and a creature's soul. <LINE> To test it, I created a special enchant,that increases the birthrates of my farm animals.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.stage.3=For the next experiment, I want to see how specific and radical I can be. I want to try to enchant a creature to breath underwater.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.stage.4=That is it for now. I created powerful enchantments that I can apply to living beings. I think I can move forward to attempting more in Biomancy now that I understand more about the interaction of flesh and magic.

research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant_advanced.title=Advanced Creature enchants
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant_advanced.stage.1=There must be more for me to do.I prepared a few ingredients that I can use to try out a new formula, that should serve as the base for a much stronger enchanting powder, that (theoratically) can increase the strength of the bond between the creature and the enchantment.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant_advanced.stage.2=I created the substance. Now I want to try out if I could increase the strenght of the creature.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant_advanced.stage.3=Success. The new enchantment is indeed potent, but it will not work alone I'll need some internal reinforcements, or else the limbs will fall off.

research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.creature_enchanter_fertile=The fertility enchantment allows enchanted animals to give birth to additional offspring. Each enchanted parent provides one extra baby.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.creature_enchanter_protection=The protection enchantment is very straightforward: every level will divide the damage that the enchanted creature will take.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.creature_enchanter_respiration=The respiration enchantment allows the enchanted creature to breath underwater.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.creature_enchanter_strength=The strength enchanter multiplies the attack damage of the enchanted entity.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.creature_enchanter_none=To create the book that serves as a base for any further creature enchanting, I need to cast a special binding by using salis mundus above an enchanting table. <LINE> I need to right click an enchanting table with salis mundus in my main hand while holding a book in my offhand. <LINE> To create the enchantment, first I need to cook up the correct formula, that I apply it to the enchanting powder.
research.thaumic_arcana.creature_enchant.powder=To safely apply this kind of magic, I also need an another substance. My new enchanting powder can store the enchantment more safely before I apply it to the book. it also helps to bind the magic to the creature.

research.thaumic_arcana.self_enchantment.title=Self Enchantment
research.thaumic_arcana.self_enchantment.stage.1=I can put enchantments on all kinds of creatures. But what if I could put them on myself? I must try it out!
research.thaumic_arcana.self_enchantment.stage.2=This was a painful failure indeed! My body is still weak and trembling from the attempt. I cannot handle the process, as about halfway through, I started to feel sick, then I was shaking violently and was unable to pronounce the incantations.<BR/> I have experienced similar reactions when I first did this to animals, but I didn't expect this. <LINE> If I could mitigate the resistance of my body, than I could move forward with it.
research.thaumic_arcana.self_enchantment.stage.3=Ahh, the bath salts. Always able to clear my mind, even when I'm waking from a nightmare. I think it could also reduce the severity of the reaction that my flesh is having while applying the enchants.
research.thaumic_arcana.self_enchantment.stage.4=Something is still missing. My hands are still shaking a bit. Maybe I could use some of my spellcasting tools to help with the process.
research.thaumic_arcana.self_enchantment.stage.5=Using a simple gauntlet is enough for the task. To cast enchantments on myself, I need to be using an enchantment table to stabilize the magic and use a gauntlet because it can channel some vis to power the process and provide some support for my hand. I also need to be under the effects of warp ward, to keep my mind clear. That way I can apply any enchantments to myself, as long as they are compatible.

research.thaumic_arcana.nutrient_mix.title=Nutrient Mix
research.thaumic_arcana.nutrient_mix.stage.1=Knowing how to grow fresh meat is good, but what If I still need the whole animal? Could I increase its growth, so I don't need to wait for very long to get a new animal?
research.thaumic_arcana.nutrient_mix.stage.2=I created a recipe for a special kind of mixture that is able to speed up the growth of any animal.

research.thaumic_arcana.leather.title=Leather Processing
research.thaumic_arcana.leather.stage.1=Now that I can make flesh, I want to figure how to make leather. In theory, I should be able to make the meat grow the hide on itself.
research.thaumic_arcana.leather.stage.2=I failed to grow the hide, but found something else. I can make the flesh harden into a leather like substance, and the process is similar to what I used on rotten flesh.

research.thaumic_arcana.tree.title=Bush Alchemy
research.thaumic_arcana.tree.stage.1=When I was growing plants, it wasn't too hard to add too much essentia, which sometimes causes its growth to go out of control. This was able to mutilate the plant. <LINE> This can be useful. If I don't care about the deformities than some new applications could emerge, namely to grow trees this way.
research.thaumic_arcana.tree.stage.2=The tree is more of a bush, but it is able to give me wood. I also need to add some vacuos to the formula, so I can improve the spatial conditions in there for long enough to make it so that it won't get stuck in my cauldron, or thaumatorium. <LINE>The leaves overgrew, and became so hard that I need to crack it open by smashing it to a wall.
research.thaumic_arcana.tree.stage.3=The process causes a yield lower than expected. I don't think I should do this to plants where this problem didn't occur.


research.thaumic_arcana.plantproducts.title=Biomanuafactury
research.thaumic_arcana.plantproducts.stage.1= Now that I figured how to force plants to grow, I want to do something different. I want to see if I can fabricate products that would normally come from different plants in more flexible ways. <LINE> The first thing I want to try is to solve a problem that has been emerging during my work. I use a lot of paper while doing research and studies. <BR> I prepared a few candidates and samples that should be usable to create paper.
research.thaumic_arcana.plantproducts.stage.2= I ended up choosing wood as the material for this. With the correct essentia, I can soften and reshape it's fibers to turn it into fine sheets of paper. <LINE> Now I want to do something different. I want to see if I could mold or even grow other resources.
