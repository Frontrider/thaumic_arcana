### Repo rules
* The usual "be polite".
* One problem = one issue. As a general rule of thumb for any repository, please don't make issues with multiple topics, makes it easier to track them.

* beef, pork, mutton (no fish)
* wheat, potatoes, carrots, beet
* pumpkins and melons
* all vanilla trees

More options for leather farming.

### Enchanting

Create a new type of enchantment, that can be applied to living creatures (including yourself), instead of inanimate objects.
types:
* fertile: increases birthrates
* protection
* strength
* respiration

### Misc

Other features:
* alchemical fertilizer (easy to mass produce)
* metal transmutation


##For modders

The creature enchantments and the formula recipes use the standard forge registry, except the formula recipes. Those need to be added to the handler, at the Init phase.
Also, you're supposed to get the references via object holders. it was done, so that you could theoratically swap out my defaults with registry editing. Please do that for custom maps only. If you need an edit for some other reason, than it might be actually needs to be done on my end.
